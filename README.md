# Small-Bazar-Project---Database-Design-and-Querying
This project is a small-scale e-commerce database for a local bazaar, created using MySQL. The database includes six main tables:

The customer table stores information about the bazaar's customers, including their name, contact information, and address.
The manager table stores information about the bazaar's managers, including their name and contact information.
The branch table stores information about the bazaar's branches, including their location and contact information.
The product table stores information about the bazaar's products, including their name, price, and quantity in stock.
The purchase_order table stores information about the orders made by customers, including the order ID and the customer ID.
The delivery table stores information about the deliveries made by the bazaar, including the delivery date, delivery charges, and order ID.
The product_order table stores information about the products included in each purchase order, including the product ID, the quantity ordered, and the total price.
Using this database, several queries can be performed to extract useful information about the bazaar's operations. For example, queries can be used to:

Retrieve monthly profit of all branches for the current year
Get total bill for any order
Retrieve all the branches available in the country that are active
Find out the country where people are using the least plastic bag while they are shopping
